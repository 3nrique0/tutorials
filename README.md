# Tutorials

Tutorials I've followed and I've shared with my co-workers and other bioinformatitians.
I know there are more resources for tutorials, but sometimes it's easier to refere to some common sources and scripts.
Plus, I can re-use these in my workshops and eventual classes ^_^



## Index and description

### 1. Python virtual environments

Some tools require a particular version of python and a particular version of libraries.
Here's a short deployment of virtual environments to install **GOATOOLS**.
Here we create 2 virtual environments and the readme contains a more detailed explanation than the scripts.


### 2. Linux introduction

I use this hierarchy of files and dummy files to make workshops of initiation to Linux in command line
I'll add the sort of thing we do there.
There are some sample files in *data* to make people practice with real files, and how to detect an empty file.
On the playground we'll be creating projects to practice more advanced things, where all errors are acceptable.
Once a script will be "ready" to work autonomously it will be placed in another folder.

#### 2.1 Current projects

A script to count the GC contents of a fasta file. Followed by the instructions to use it


### 3. Slurm

Slurm is a cluster management and job scheduling system.
We access it thanks to Genotoul, a french calculation cluster specialized in bioinformatics maintained by MIAT unit from INRAE.

### Deprecated

These are old lessons for python environments and QSE.
QSE has been deprecated, and people use conda rather than virtual environments.
They are still in this directory since they could be used as directories and files to explore and do other exercises with them.
