# Tutorials

Tutorials I've followed and I've shared with my co-workers and other bioinformatitians.
I know there are more resources for tutorials, but sometimes it's easier to refere to some common sources and scripts.
Plus, I can re-use these in my workshops and eventual classes ^_^



## Index and description

Here we create 2 virtual envs and the readme contains a more detailed explanation than the scripts
