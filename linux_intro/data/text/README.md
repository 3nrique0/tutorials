Before going int bioinformatic files, we will start working with basic text manipulation
I chose some more or less famous texts so we can arrange/read/copy/edit files

This same files will be used to learn to find, grep, sed and awk text

### TRY

The directory try contains files with *The lord of the rings poem*
Objective: Let people exploire files, find file types, and determine if the file types are valid


### EXPLORE

First timer ? Just explore these files, We want to read them, and concatenate them in the proper order
Second timer ? There are some extra lines to get rid of, so command line text editing !
