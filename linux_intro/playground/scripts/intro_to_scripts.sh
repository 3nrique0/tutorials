### WELCOME TO A BASH SCRIPT !

# <- The hashtags are used to comment lines
# <- Any text written after them won't be seen as code by the computer
# <- All text after a hashtag, included, is named a COMMENT
# <- Like how ??


date > date.txt  # Like this




### <- Do I need to put that many comment symbols ?

# <- No, but it helps structure the script
# Can I write more than one line ? -- Sure ! as far as you start with a 
# Is this section going to be any useful ?? -- Nope, but it's a nice description




### Shebang

#  Also named sha-bang, hashbang, pound-bang, or hash-pling
# It's a character composed of a # and a !
# Both work toghether as one single character, it's an interpreter directive
# It will tell the program loader with which language it should interpret the code




### What is it for ?

# Here you can write or copy paste the set of command lines which allow you
# to achieve a particular task




#### Why is it important ?

# One word: REPETABILITY
# This is the exact procedure to repeat the same task from the same dataset.
# Isn't it cooler than trying to explain where did you clicked on excel ??
