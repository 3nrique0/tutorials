## Introduction to Slurm

The aim of this tutorial is to give only basic usage for newcomers in SLURM.

The scripts here present are only examples with no real use, they can be used as a template.

This tutorial is aimed, for now, to users to use genotoul cluster. 
This being a basic tutorial it can be applied elsewhere.

This introduction will allow to open new questions to other tutorials like:

* Introduction to Linux command line - bash
* How computers work
* Advanced job launching in slurm (arrays)
* Advanced job management - without being an administrator
* Good practices

## The order of use of the scripts is suggested as following

### template_script.txt

A reminder of how a script is organised

### myscript.sh

Very basic bash script to be launched with `bash` and with `sbatch`
